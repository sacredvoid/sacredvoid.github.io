**Disclaimer** : This is only for Mac and Linux users.<br><br>

Did you ever wish that your terminal was like your code-editor where commands would automatically complete themselves and there would be themes to personalize it? <br><br>
Well, there is a life saver out there called [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) which is **basically like red-bull for terminals**, it will give your terminal wings! (No, not really)<br><br>
The **Z shell** (also known as zsh) is a Unix shell that is built on top of bash (the default shell for macOS) with additional features. It's recommended to use zsh over bash. It's also highly recommended to install a framework with zsh as it makes dealing with configuration, plugins and themes a lot nicer.<br><br>
**Oh My Zsh** is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh (another shell like bash) configuration. It comes with a bunch of features out of the box and improves your terminal experience.<br>

Every coder uses terminal in some way or other, some more than others, but when you open that black box with a prompt, I think it just takes you back to the 1970s with that outdated look (imho). So let's go ahead and install it on our systems.<br><br>

>_Prerequisites: Git_

<br>

**Oh-my-zsh Installation Steps**:
- Open your terminal and go to your home folder :
`cd ~`
- **To install ZSH** run:
    - Linux : <br>
    `sudo apt install zsh`
    - Mac : <br>
    `brew install zsh`
- Once that is done, to **install Oh My Zsh** run: <br>
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` <br> <br>

>_This will prompt you if you want to change your default shell to zsh, upon which you should type in 'y' or 'yes' and press enter._

<br>
Voila! Your terminal is upgraded now. You can close the terminal and re-open it to see if the default shell is now zsh. If it's not, you'll have to logout and log back in to your computer for changes to take place. <br>

Let's add plugins to zsh now! Te plugins we will be installing are:
- zsh-auto-complete
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- zsh-history-substring-search

<br>
**Plugins Installation Steps:**
- Run the following commands one after the other:

    - `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search`
    - `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
    - `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting`

<br>

After downloading the required plugins, all we have to do is add them in our configuration file which is _~/.zshrc_ . Open this file in any of your favourite editors (vi, vim, nano, gedit) and find the 'plugins' option in your zshrc file. <br>Add the three plugins like this:<br>
`plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions history-substring-search zsh-syntax-highlighting)`

Save and exit from the editor, and then run the command: <br>
`source ~/.zshrc`

This applies the changes you have just made. Now just type any command like _git_ and it should get highlighted. 

Cheers!
