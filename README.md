# sacredvoid.github.io

[This website](https://sacredvoid.github.io) is made using the jekyll theme called: [Grape Theme](https://github.com/naye0ng/Grape-Theme). \
I've made additional changes like an About Page, some theme changes, location (in Portfolio). \
Blog post on [how to create your own portfolio/landing page using Jekyll](https://sacredvoid.github.io/2020/07/14/get_started_with_jekyll.html) is out now! Check it out :)
It's currently WIP, but you can feel free to fork and make it your own!
