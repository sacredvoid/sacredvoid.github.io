This website is made using the jekyll theme called: [Grape Theme](https://github.com/naye0ng/Grape-Theme). \
I've made additional changes like an About Page, some theme changes, location (in Portfolio). A blog post on how to navigate this directory will be up by next week. \
It's currently WIP, but you can feel free to fork and make it your own!
